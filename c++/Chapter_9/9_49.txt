Although MT wq wasted a lot of resource, the level of concurrency
provided was unsatisfactory.  The limitation was common to both ST and
MT wq albeit less severe on MT.  Each wq maintained its own separate
worker pool.  A MT wq could provide only one execution context per CPU
while a ST wq one for the whole system.  Work items had to compete for
those very limited execution contexts leading to various problems
including proneness to deadlocks around the single execution context. jh
